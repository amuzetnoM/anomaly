JOURNAL

















2017





S.B.⨺





























































































August 14

Her apartment feels wrong.

The air feels thick, like I'm breathing through cotton. The silence isn't just silence… it's compressed, waiting, pressing into my skin.

I've been here for hours, but it feels like I haven't entered yet. Like I'm standing outside myself, watching someone else move my hands, breathe my air. The walls press in closer. The light sits too still. The silence doesn't wait to be broken. It just is.

Sarah's absence isn't an emptiness, it's a presence. A weight. A constant hum in the air that makes the hairs on my arms stand up on their ends.

I turn on the TV, but sound cuts too sharp, like a blade slicing through fabric. The voices don't sound like voices at all. Too crisp, too separate from the room. As if they belong to something else, somewhere else. And when I turn it off,  the silence just rushes back in.

It took me almost three hours to get myself to start sorting Sarah’s stuff.

First, I opened a drawer. Closed it. Walked to the kitchen. Came back. Sat down. Opened it again.

Her things remain arranged like she'll be back in a few hours to pick them up. But who am I kidding.

I picked up her scarf. Still smells like her. Faint, but there. The part of my brain that understands science says it's just residual molecules clinging to the fabric. The rest of me doesn't care. I hold it until my knuckles ache.

Her notebooks are worse. Sarah was messy, pages crammed with ideas, sketches, notes in the margins that only made sense to her perhaps.

I tried reading them, but it's all equations and diagrams I can barely decipher. It's like trying to have a conversation with a ghost who speaks a language I never learned.





I found her coffee mug…

I don't even know why I picked it up, but suddenly I'm there…

        Morning light slanting through the window, Sarah laughing as she cradles the same cup in both hands, steam curling up around her face.

It's too clear. Too clear. The memory slams into me like I'm reliving it, not remembering. I can hear her voice, smell the coffee, feel the warmth of her knee brushing against mine as she shifts in her seat.

Then it's gone.

I try to hold onto it, but the harder I reach, the faster it dissolves. Did she really laugh like that? 

Or am I rewriting it, smoothing over the edges, creating something cleaner than it was?

I’m forgetting stuff. A LOT. 

How do I keep my memories from corroding like this?





Something is off.

It's not the silence… it's the way it's listening.

I sat in the living room, unmoving, staring at nothing. There's no reason to feel watched. But I did. 

At one point, I caught my reflection in the window. Just a glance. But for a split second… I could swear it blinked before I did.





but that's just me… 

Of course… it's just me.





I checked her drawer three times.

This note, it wasn't there before.

It's Sarah's handwriting, no doubt about it… Right? 

But I don't remember this note. I don't remember ever seeing it, ever hearing her talk about it, ever watching her write it.

It just says:

" Don't look for me."

The ink is too dark, like the pen pressed too hard against the paper. Like she wanted to make sure I saw it.

I don't know if I was supposed to find this.

Then something caught my eye. Right on the floor near Sarah’s easel, caught in the grain of the wood like it had been there… forever. 

A thread.

Red. Bleak. Out of place, waiting to be noticed. I bent down, fingertips brushing against it.

The moment I touched it, my skin crawled… like running my hand over static, or velvet pressed the wrong way, revealing something sharp and unexpected beneath.

It wasn’t fabric. Not exactly.

I pulled. It held for a second, like it was hooked into something deeper, then just came loose, too easily. No resistance, no weight. It shouldn’t have been… satisfying.





I head something. My skin pale went pale, felt like time had melted away for a moment.

It was a whisper.

It was Soft. Too soft to be.. real. Like the sound wasn’t in the room, but somewhere behind it.

Not a word. Not a voice. Just the impression of something speaking, too low to hear, curling at the edges of my mind like smoke slipping through a crack in the air.

I keep thinking I imagined it.

I keep thinking I didn’t.

I don’t know what I’m looking for exactly…

I’ve been staring at Sarah’s last painting for an hour. It isn’t finished—her brushstrokes frozen mid-motion, paint dragged but not filled, shapes emerging from the raw canvas but never fully formed.

I keep blinking, expecting it to shift.

I think the colors deepen, the edges sharpen, the empty space folds in on itself… becoming something almost recognizable?

Maybe it’s the light. Maybe I’m tired. Maybe…

I don’t know.

Something in me says “ leave it alone! ”

Something else… won't let me. 









Things on my mind:

Thread.

Red.

Pocket.

Can’t.

Not yet.

Painting.

Shifting.

Whisper.

Still there.









August 15

________________





Mrs. Abernathy knocked twice. Sharply, deliberately. 

The sound echoed too loud for such a small noise. It cut through the silence like a crack forming in glass.

I thought about not answering.

But the silence had been pressing down on me all morning, and the idea of another human being's voice… even hers… felt like a relief.

She smiled too wide when I opened the door. It gave me chills. 

She didn’t step back from the doorway. Just stood there… waiting, like she expected an invitation.

I told her I was fine.

She nodded, but her eyes narrowed, like she was trying to see through me. Her gaze moving past me, scanning the apartment. Too slow, too focused. I almost stepped aside for her, before I caught myself.

She didn’t blink enough. That’s what I realized as she talked. Her voice lilting, warm, yet slightly too… rehearsed. 

Her gaze was the real problem. It stayed too long, pressing against my skin, searching...

She was waiting for something.

”You poor thing,” she said…  she meant it, but not in the way she should. I wanted her to leave. She wasn’t leaving.

She lingered around a bit asking me if id notice Sarah's behavior. Of course I did. I may have been the reason behind it. 

After she finally decided to leave, I went back to Sarah’s easel. The painting had been bothering me since last night. Something about the brushstrokes. Unfinished but intentional. Had she been covering something instead of creating it.

I hesitated, then ran my fingers along the edges of the canvas. The surface shifted under my hand. Not the painting. The entire top layer. 

I peeled it back.

Underneath…Nothing. A perfectly blank canvas.

Unnatural Smoothness

I ran my hand across it. Too smooth. Not just blank—erased. Paint should leave something behind. A shadow of color, a stain in the fibers. This was clean, untouched, like nothing had ever existed there. Like nothing was allowed to exist there.

I stepped back. My chest tightened. Sarah painted this. Sarah erased this. Why? What was she hiding? What am I missing?

The Impossible Sketch

I tore through her things. I don’t even know what I was looking for. I just needed something real, something Sarah left behind that hadn’t been wiped clean.

I found a sketchbook shoved under a pile of papers. First few pages were normal. Then—

A drawing.

Not one of hers. I know all of her work. I would have remembered this.

It was a place. A real place. But I don’t recognize it.

The architecture was strange—alien, almost. Angles that seemed to defy gravity, lines that curved in ways that made no sense.

How did she draw something she never saw?

How do I recognize something I’ve never been to?

Seeing the Unseen

Sarah saw something I didn’t.

She knew something I wasn’t supposed to.

And now—

Now it’s looking at me.

Cold. Hungry.

August 16

________________





I’ve been listening to it for hours.

My head throbs now.

Sarah’s voice.

It shouldn’t still exist. But it does.

A recording, a sequence of sounds stored in a machine. Just data.

But data doesn’t change.

If it does, then nothing is real. Nothing is safe.

The throbbing intensifies—a dull ache behind my eyes, rhythmic, like a pulse that isn’t mine.

The Obsession

Play.

“Simon… I don’t have much time.”

Pause.

Rewind.

Play.

“Simon… I don’t have much time.”

Pause.

Rewind.

Again. Again. Again.

The words are burned into my skull, but they still don’t make sense.

Not the words themselves. The way she says them.

Like she’s trying to tell me something else. Like I’m missing something hidden in the way her voice cracks on the word ‘time’.

A sharp pain lances through my temple. I rub it, but it doesn’t help.

I need to hear it again.

Distorted Voice

Her voice isn’t right.

It’s her—but it’s not.

Like a version of her speaking through layers of glass, warped by something pressing in from the other side.

Tiny shifts in pitch, her voice bending underwater.

Soft static under the words, faint but alive, like breathing.

Like something else is in there with her, listening along.

The static grows louder, blurring the edges of my vision.

Shifting Message

I swear—I swear—it changed.

First, I thought I misheard. My brain filling in gaps. But no.

“Simon… I don’t have much time.”

I play it again.

“Simon… I don’t have time.”

The word “much” is gone.

Play it again.

“Simon… I don’t—”

Cut off.

This isn’t possible. Recordings don’t change. They don’t.

Am I hearing it wrong? Or is something else—someone else—rewriting it?

My stomach churns. The room tilts for just a second. I feel like I’m going to be sick.

Dismissal

I took it to the police. I don’t even know what I expected.

The officer listened once. Expression blank. Too polite.

“Grief does strange things to the mind.” That’s what she said.

She handed my phone back like it was nothing, avoiding my eyes, already moving on to the next case.

I wanted to scream. I almost did. But I swallowed it down, along with the bile rising in my throat.

The World Moving On

Outside, the world remains intact. Cars hum down the street. People order coffee. Laughter drifts from an open window. Everything is normal.

But I feel like a ghost, moving through a reality that no longer recognizes me.

Sarah is dead. I should be grieving. Instead, I’m trapped inside this loop, each replay chipping away at my sanity. Each replay sending a fresh wave of pain through my head.

Unheard Message

She’s still trying to talk to me. I can feel it. But the words are slipping. Like someone doesn’t want me to hear them.

Like something is pressing against the other side of the recording, forcing her voice through gaps too small to carry meaning, desperate to silence her completely.

Play.

“Simon… I don’t—” Gone.

The world tips sideways for a second. I need to lie down.

________________





August 17

I woke up with the headache already there. Not like a normal headache.

This felt alien. Something pressing from the inside, burrowing deep behind my eyes, pushing at the edges of my skull like it was trying to carve space for itself.

I took a pill. It didn't help.

The Routine

The routine keeps me anchored.

Shower. Coffee. Lecture notes. Step-by-step, like an equation that still balances.

Or at least used to. Now, it feels like I'm forcing the numbers to fit, twisting the rules to keep the illusion alive.

I reach for my keys. They're not there. Not on the counter. Not in my bag.

I check my coat pocket. There they are.

But I swear—I checked there first.

A wave of nausea crashes over me.

If I can't trust my own memory, what can I trust?

The Glitch

The university feels wrong.

Not empty, not full—just off.

Students move in clusters, their voices too distant, like a muted recording playing underwater. Their faces blur at the edges, features shifting just out of focus.

The hallways seem longer than usual, stretched just slightly, like the space between steps has expanded without my permission.

I shake it off. Keep moving.

I step into my lecture hall.

Stop.

There's a man at the podium.

My podium.

A professor I don't recognize, adjusting the microphone, arranging his notes.

He looks up. Straight at me.

And smiles.

Like he expected me.

The Denial

"Can I help you?"

I stare.

The students are watching now. Silent. Waiting.

"This is my class," I say. My voice feels distant, like I'm hearing it through a thick wall.

The professor chuckles.

Like I'm confused.

Like I'm the one out of place.

"I think you're mistaken," he says.

His smile doesn't reach his eyes.

They're cold, calculating.

And then—the worst part.

The students don't react.

They just keep looking at me, blank-faced, as if they've never seen me before.

I scan the rows desperately.

Not a single familiar face.

Not a single flicker of recognition.

Like I've never been here before.

The Search

I left before I could hear the next lie.

Through the hall, past the offices, straight to my department's admin desk.

"Simon Cole. Faculty. Where's my office?"

Blank stare.

Empty eyes. Unseeing.

A click of the keyboard. A confused frown.

"You're not in the system."

________________





My hands won't stay steady.

I check the faculty directory.

My name isn't there.

I check my email—login fails.

Panic flares in my chest. It's like I'm being erased, one digital trace at a time.

 

I check my office—my office doesn't exist.

The door is there. The number is right.

But inside—someone else's books. Someone else's desk. Someone else's goddamn chair.

I stumble back into the hall.

My heartbeat hammers against my ribs.

This isn't happening.

It can't be happening.

The Fracture

I grip the wall, try to breathe.

But my vision blurs.

The lights overhead flicker, but only for me.

The walls seem to breathe.

Memories slip—I was here yesterday. I taught yesterday. I did, didn't I?

I try to pull up the memory.

It's fogged, distant—like looking through warped glass.

I can almost see their faces, hear their questions—

But it's like trying to catch smoke with bare hands.

My fingers dig into my scalp, press against my skull like I can force the thoughts back into place.

My stomach lurches. The floor tilts.

The Rupture

A sharp explosion of pain behind my eyes.

Like a bomb detonating in my skull.

A high-pitched ringing drowns out everything.

People walking past move too fast, then too slow.

The walls tilt inward, then pull back.

I try to steady myself, but my knees buckle.

Falling.

The last thing I see is the floor rushing up to meet me.

Then—

Black.





I wake up somewhere else.

I don't remember getting here.

Head still pounding, throbbing in pulses like a second heartbeat.

I reach for my bag. My phone. My keys.

But for one long, terrible second—

I don’t remember Sarah’s face.

Time is so relative when you start losing it. I fell asleep on my desk, I can swear I remember it. 

I wake up somewhere I really don’t remember lying down.

My back is stiff, my muscles are cramped, and the cold tiles are leeching the heat from my skin.

The floor is hard beneath me. Cold.

The grout lines dig into my cheek.

My breath catches easy… The air feels thick, like dust has settled in my lungs.

For a moment, I don’t know what day it is.

Or where I am.

Did I teach yesterday?

What did I teach?

The Aftermath

I sit up slowly.

Muscles stiff, skin too tight over my bones. Every movement feels delayed, like my body and my mind are slightly out of sync.

I touch the back of my head. No blood. Just pain, radiating outward, pulsing like a second heartbeat.

I press my fingertips against my temple.

What happened yesterday?

Flashes—

The professor. The empty faces. The erased office.

The moment before I hit the ground—a static burst of pain behind my eyes, something rupturing.

It’s all a blur. A broken transmission.

I should go to a hospital.

But I don’t.

The Return

I don’t know why I came back here.

Back to the apartment.

I stood outside for ten minutes before unlocking the door.

Something about the silence feels wrong—like the apartment was holding its breath, waiting for me.

I step inside.

The air is thick, stale, pressing against my skin.

Sarah’s painting is askew on the wall.

It wasn’t like that before.

The Revelation

I tear through Sarah’s things.

Faster now. Desperate.

There has to be something here. A reason for all of this.

Her notebooks, her sketches—I go through them all, flipping pages too fast, my hands shaking.

Then—

A single sheet of paper, folded, tucked between the pages of an old book.

I don’t remember seeing it before.

I open it.

The paper feels cold and slick against my fingertips.

A sketch.

And my breath leaves me.

The Familiarity

I know this place.

But I don’t.

The image is wrong, but right—like remembering a dream you never had.

The structures in the drawing seem to bend where they shouldn’t, curve at angles that defy logic.

It feels like a memory.

A place I’ve never been. A place I’m not supposed to remember.

The archway on the left side of the building…

It sends a shiver down my spine.

Sarah drew this.

Why do I know it?

The Glimpse

The hairs on my arms rise.

Something moves in my peripheral vision.

A shadow.

A flicker of something dark and amorphous, like ink spreading in water.

I turn.

Nothing.

The room is still.

But I know—I know—something is watching.

My pulse hammers in my throat.

I squeeze my eyes shut. Count to five. Open them.

Still alone.

Still not alone.

The Certainty

It’s not just a feeling anymore.

I know it.

I am being watched.

Not the way you feel someone looking at you in a crowded room.

Not a trick of the mind.

Something is here.

I can feel its gaze on my skin, cold and invasive, like a hand pressing against my back.

I try to move, but my body is locked—every muscle frozen under the weight of unseen eyes.

Like I’m under glass, an insect pinned in place.

I force myself to breathe.

Then—

A sound.

Soft. Subtle.

A shift in the air behind me.

The Descent

I don’t turn around.

I can’t.

Because if I do, it will be there.

I shut my eyes.

I count again.

One.

Two.

Three—

The whisper.

Too close.

Right against my ear.

Not alone. Not alone. Not alone.

The headache spikes, sharp enough to blind me.

I drop to my knees, gasping.

My vision blacks out at the edges, tunneling, collapsing.

The last thing I hear is my own breath, ragged and uneven.

And something else, breathing with me.

August 18

________________





I should stop.

I should stop looking.

I should burn everything.

But Sarah’s face stops me.

Her hands on a brush, her fingers tracing pages, her laughter still echoing in the corners of this apartment.

So I keep digging.

The Discovery

Sarah’s things are everywhere.

Books, sketches, pages torn from notebooks. I can’t even tell what I’m looking for anymore.

My hands move faster than my mind, throwing things aside. I should be careful. I should be careful. I don’t care.

Then—

Something heavy thuds against the floor.

A small wooden box.

Dark mahogany, polished smooth. A relic from another life.

The latch is delicate, curved like a spiral that pulls the eye inward, toward an unseen center.

I don’t remember this.

I should remember this.

The Relic

I pick it up, turn it over.

The wood is warm.

Too warm.

Fingertips run along the delicate engravings. Small flowers. A name—worn down by time.

Sarah’s?

The latch clicks under my touch.

The lid creaks open.

Inside, a metal crank.

I wind it—or try to.

The gears won’t budge. Rusted stiff, locked in place.

It’s broken.

It can’t play.

Then—

It plays.

The Anomaly

The melody seeps into the room.

Soft. Slow.

A hollow, winding sound, like something dragging its fingers across the edges of reality.

My stomach turns.

It sounds wrong.

Like it was never meant to be heard.

The notes vibrate in my teeth, not my ears.

Each note lingers too long. Stretched. Distorted.

The hairs on my arms rise.

I didn’t wind it.

I couldn’t wind it.

But it’s playing.

And I’m still holding it.

Beyond the Music

This isn’t a song.

It’s a whisper.

The notes don’t follow a melody. They follow a pattern.

Repeating. Shifting. Repeating again.

I close my eyes.

Try to listen the way Sarah would.

There’s something beneath the music.

Something hidden in the spaces between the notes.

It wants me to hear.

It needs me to understand.

But I can’t shake the feeling that understanding this might destroy me.

The Twist

The song changes.

The notes shift.

The rhythm stumbles, slows, rewinds. Starts again.

Familiar, but...different.

Like it’s learning.

Like it’s watching me.

Like it’s watching me listen.

Each repetition adds something new.

A single extra note.

A subtle key change.

Like a sentence, rewriting itself mid-thought.

Like it’s waiting for me to catch on.

The wood vibrates against my palm, in time with my pulse.

I snap the lid shut.

The Humming

Silence.

My breath is too loud.

My hands are shaking.

The tune is still playing.

No.

Not playing.

I’m humming it.

________________





I don’t remember starting.

I don’t remember learning it.

But the sound won’t leave my throat.

My jaw clenches.

I try to stop, but the hum vibrates up from my chest.

My lips move on their own.

A lullaby I never heard. A song I can’t stop singing.

The box is closed.

The music should be gone.

But it isn’t.

It’s inside me.

It knows me now.

And I can’t make it stop.

August 19

________________





I haven’t eaten.

I haven’t slept.

I don’t remember the last time I blinked.

Or the last time I looked in the mirror.

I’m afraid of what I might see.

The Obsession Continues

The painting.

It’s all I see now.

I don’t even know how long I’ve been staring at it.

Hours? Days?

The clock stopped ticking hours ago.

Or maybe I just stopped hearing it.

Either way, time is merely the shifting of light on the canvas.

Hours of Staring

The light changes. The shadows shift.

But I stay.

My spine is locked in place.

My breath tastes stale.

My eyes feel carved from stone.

I don’t move.

Because it’s moving for me.

The Click

It happens suddenly.

Like a key turning in a lock.

A pressure behind my eyes builds—then releases.

And I see it.

My vision snaps into focus.

The brushstrokes are too deliberate.

The colors too precise.

It was never abstract.

It was never a painting.

It was a message.

The Cipher Revealed

It’s in the way the strokes curve.

The way the color shifts under the light.

A sequence.

A pattern.

A cipher.

Every line points to another.

Every shade corresponds to something.

It was never chaos.

It was designed.

And Sarah wanted me to see it.

Or something wanted me to see it through her.

A Message from Sarah

Sarah left this for me.

For anyone who was willing to look.

She knew.

She knew.

And now—

So do I.

August 20

________________





I am further than I meant to go.

But I can’t stop now.

Not when I’m finally starting to understand.

My teeth ache, like something is pushing them from the inside.

The New Path

The painting was just the beginning.

The Dominion is what lies beyond.

I don’t know when I made the decision.

I don’t remember opening my laptop, pulling up the browser, typing those words.

But here I am.

Researching. Reading. Digging.

Finding things that should not be found.

I had a choice before.

I don’t anymore.

Delving Deeper

I don’t know how long I’ve been reading.

The light outside has changed colors twice.

Three times?

Every time I check the clock, the numbers swim, rearranging themselves into something that shouldn’t exist.

Like 15:87.

________________





My search history looks insane.

Obscure forums. Digitized manuscripts buried in archives no one visits. Old scanned books with missing pages.

Everything leads somewhere else.

Every link, a door.

Every passage, a warning.

I am not supposed to be reading this.

And yet, the deeper I go, the more I recognize.

Words I should not know.

Symbols I’ve never seen—but somehow remember.

The Symbols

They follow me.

Not just in the texts.

On my walls. In my peripherals.

Behind my eyes when I blink.

At first, I thought I was imagining it—residual images from too much screen time.

But they’re not fading.

They are etching themselves into me.

What disappears is never truly absent.

It echoes in the spaces in between.

It leeches into everything else.

That phrase again.

I don’t know where I read it.

Or if I did.

Maybe it was always there.

Waiting for me to find it.

The Vanishing File

I found something.

A file.

Plain text. Buried deep in an archive that shouldn’t exist.

It was about them. The Orphic Dominion.

Their beliefs. Their practices. Their warnings.

I saved it.

I read it twice.

I went to open it again—

Gone.

Not just closed. Not just deleted.

Vanished completely, like it was never there at all.

Like it was never meant to be found.

Someone is watching me.

Someone knows.

Knows what I’m thinking.

Knows what I’m searching for.

Knows me better than I know myself.

The Change

Something shifted.

I felt it.

Like stepping through an invisible door and realizing the floor behind you is gone.

Like waking up and remembering something you never lived.

Like seeing a word written in a language you don’t know and still understanding it.

I look in the mirror.

For a second, I don’t recognize my own face.

The eyes are wrong.

Too wide. Too hungry.

I blink.

It’s me again.

But something is different.

I don’t know what.

I don’t know if I want to know.

August 21

________________





I didn’t sleep.

I tried.

Every time I closed my eyes, something moved in the dark.

A whisper of cloth.

The scrape of a fingernail on wood.

I don’t think it was real.

I don’t think it wasn’t.

The Waiting

I can feel them now.

Not just watching.

Waiting.

Like the moment before a speaker crackles to life, before an actor steps onto a stage.

The world is holding its breath.

So am I.

The Arrival

It was on my desk.

Right in the center.

Like it had always been there.

A single card.

Facedown.

My stomach turns.

I don’t want to touch it.

But I already have.

The Weight

It should be paper.

It should be nothing.

But it isn’t.

It’s too heavy.

Or maybe I’m just too light.

Like I’m fading away.

It pulls at my fingers, like it’s trying to root itself inside my skin.

Like it’s part of something larger.

Like I am.

The Smudges

Blackened fingerprints at the edges.

Not mine.

Someone else’s.

Someone who was holding it before me.

Recently.

Too recently.

Maybe they’re still here.

The Laughter

I turn it over.

The Joker grins back.

A grin that doesn’t belong on a piece of paper.

A grin that is too aware.

The edges twitch.

Or maybe my vision does.

But I hear it.

Soft.

Distant.

Laughter.

And I don’t know if it’s coming from the card—

Or from me.

Maybe it’s both of us now.

The Memory

A flicker at the edge of my mind.

A memory that isn’t mine.

A cold floor. A deck of cards. A voice that is not mine, but familiar.

I blink, and it’s gone.

But it was there.

Something is trying to place itself inside me.

And I think I might already know its name.

A playing card.

A painted smile.

August 22

________________





Something is about to happen.

I can feel it.

My skin crawls.

The air tastes like static. Like burnt metal.

Like something is about to break.

The Edge of Madness

I haven’t left the apartment.

I don’t trust what’s outside anymore.

I don’t even trust what’s inside.

The Joker card sits on my desk.

I won’t touch it.

I don’t dare.

It’s watching me.

I can feel it.

Like a weight pressing down on my skull.

Not a thought. Not an object.

Something else.

Waiting.

The Stutter

The lights flicker.

Not like a power surge. Not random.

Like a blink.

Like the apartment is forgetting to exist for a fraction of a second.

I hear the fridge humming in the kitchen.

Then I don’t.

Then I do.

Then I don’t again.

Like sound itself is being stitched together wrong.

A chord from a song repeats and repeats.

Then skips.

Then repeats again.

Out of time.

The Dark Spaces

The flickering stops.

But the dark stays.

The space between the light and shadow feels bigger than before.

Something is there.

I don’t see it.

But I see it move.

Like a shape shifting just out of sight.

Like something learning how to exist in our world.

The Reflection

I make the mistake of looking in the mirror.

And my reflection doesn’t look back.

Not immediately.

It lags.

Like a delayed video feed.

Like it had to catch up.

My breath stutters in my throat.

I raise a hand.

It doesn’t move.

I lower my hand.

It still hasn’t moved.

Then—

It smiles.

And I don’t.

I can feel the muscles in my face refusing to move.

Like they are being controlled by something else entirely.

The Question

I stagger back.

Trip.

Hit the floor.

The Joker card flutters down beside me.

I don’t pick it up.

I can’t.

I press my hands to my face, desperate to feel something. Reassurance. A boundary. Anything real.

And then the thought cuts through everything else.

Like a voice that isn’t mine.

Like something that has been waiting for me to ask.

Am I even real?

August 23

________________





I don’t know what to write.

I don’t know why I’m writing.

The pen feels wrong in my hand.

Am I even holding it?

I. The Lingering Doubt

The light is...off.

Not flickering.

Just dim.

Wrong.

Like it’s being filtered through something dark.

II. The Rewriting Begins

I have to stop this.

(I cross it out. Hard. The ink smears across the page.)

I have to stop this.

(It’s still there, mocking me.)

I just started this sentence.

Now the sun is setting.

What happened to those hours?

III. An Echo

The thread is the key.

(I didn’t write that.)

(I stare at the words. The letters are precise. Cold. Not mine.)

(I scratch frantically at the ink, but it barely fades beneath my fingernails.)

IV. The Struggle

I’m scared.

I don’t know what’s happening to me.

To my mind.

This isn’t my writing.

(The words get tighter, more erratic, desperate.)

Help me.

Please.

Is anyone there?

V. The Message

(The next words are in different handwriting. Stiff. Perfect. Alien.)

THIS IS NOT YOUR CONCERN.

THE RITUAL IS PREPARED.

THE GATEWAY OPENS.

VI. The Journal’s Warning

(I grip the pen. I force myself to write. My hand shakes violently.)

Get rid of the journal.

Before it gets rid of you.

(The last line is smudged—erased, mid-sentence.)

August 24

I. The Wrongness

The paper...it’s rougher.

Not like it used to be.

Like sandpaper against my fingertips.

And the ink smells…

Like rust.

Like blood.

II. The Imitation

I can’t…

I can’t hold the pen right.

My fingers are stiff.

Numb.

(I look back at what I wrote. The handwriting is wrong.)

That’s not my hand.

That’s…

It looks like my writing.

But it’s not.

A copy.

A bad one.

(I scribble over a word, trying to erase it, but it only smears.)

The void stares back.

III. The Missing Time

Where…?

Where did the pages go?

There’s nothing here.

Just…blank.

(I flip through the journal. Days are missing.)

I’m losing time.

I’m losing myself.

What’s happening to me?

IV. The Countdown

(The next words are stiff, alien, and in Courier New.)

SIX DAYS UNTIL THE RITUAL.

SIX DAYS UNTIL COMPLETION.

SIX DAYS UNTIL SILENCE.

V. The Fading

(I grip the pen. I have to fight back.)

No…

I won’t let you…

This is my mind…

My life…

(The words get smaller, fainter. My hand shakes. I can barely hold the pen.)

VI. The Journal’s Claim

(The last line is cold, absolute, and in Courier New.)

THIS JOURNAL NOW BELONGS TO THE DOMINION.

August 25

I. The Erasure

________________





(The ink is too dark. The strokes are too sharp. My name does not appear on this page.)

(I try to write it. It vanishes before I finish the last letter.)

(I try again. The paper absorbs it. Swallows it. Rejects it.)

(I… I am still here… right?)

II. The Record (Written entirely in Courier New—Adam’s voice is absolute.)

THE CHAMBER IS READY.

THE PARAMETERS HAVE BEEN SET.

THE SUBJECT’S AWARENESS IS DIMINISHING.

HIS RESISTANCE IS NEGLIGIBLE.

III. The Void Where Simon Was

________________





(I write. My words don’t stay.)

(I try to carve them into the page. The page remains unmarked.)

(I whisper them under my breath. My mouth forgets how to shape the sounds.)

(I... I am still here... right?)

IV. The Precision of Control (Courier New—cold, exact.)

THE FINAL PHASE BEGINS.

SIX HAVE BEEN PREPARED.

ONE WILL COMPLETE THE DESIGN.

THE CHAMBER AWAITS OCCUPANCY.

V. The Last Whisper of Simon

________________





(A final fragment of his voice. A dying echo.)

Let me out.

(It fades as soon as it is written.)

August 26

I. A Crack in the Facade (Courier New—Adam’s controlled, structured voice.)

THE PROCESS CONTINUES.

SUBJECT... FUNCTIONAL.

(A pause. A hesitation. The first sign of uncertainty.)

...SUBJECT... STABLE.

(The correction is forced. The words feel wrong.)

II. A Ghostly Touch

________________





(A single word appears. Not in Adam’s hand. Not in Simon’s.)

(A different ink. A different weight.)

(remember)

(It’s small. Fragile. But undeniably hers.)

(Sarah.)

(Adam immediately scratches it out.)

...ERROR...

III. The Ripple Effect

________________





(Then, a memory. Real. Unfiltered.)

(Sunlight on her hair. A brief, golden flicker.)

(A feeling—warmth. Familiarity. Love.)

(It shouldn’t be here.)

(But it is.)

(And that means something.)

IV. The Infection of Doubt

________________





(Simon’s voice returns—weak, fragmented, but alive.)

(Did we...?)

(A pause. A glitch in the system.)

(Were we ever...?)

(Adam’s response is immediate, clinical, sharp.)

THE CITY IS QUIET.

THE CITY IS SAFE.

(But the words feel hollow now.)

V. The Price of Truth

________________





(The resistance grows. Simon’s thoughts become sharper.)

(They lied to us.)

(It was all a lie.)

(Adam fights desperately to regain control. The journal slips from his trembling grasp.)

THE CITY... OBEYS.

VI. A Defiant Spark

________________





(The text fractures. Sentences repeat. Words distort and blur.)

ALL IS AS IT SHOULD BE.

THERE ARE NO DISCREPANCIES.

THERE IS... ORDER.

(The last word quivers uncertainly.)

(The ink trembles, shaking violently, rebelling against the hand that wrote it.)

August 27

I. The Shifting Sands

________________





(Words transform mid-sentence. Handwriting glitches—Simon’s jagged desperate scrawl fighting against Adam’s cold mechanical precision, overlapping, battling for dominance.)

I can’t—

WE ARE IN CONTROL.

I won’t let you—

(Ink moves with unnatural fluidity. Letters bleed and merge. Some words stretch impossibly, others flicker in and out of existence.)

II. Contradictions

________________





(The journal wages war against itself.)

It’s over.

IT HAS ONLY BEGUN.

Sarah is gone.

SHE IS STILL HERE.

I remember.

NO, YOU DON’T.

(Two voices. Two realities. Locked in eternal conflict.)

III. The Overwrite

________________





(Sentences materialize. Vanish. Reappear—twisted, corrupted, wrong.)

The sky is blue.

The sky is red.

The sky—

(A void where words should be. Ink retreats as if forcibly pulled back mid-thought.)

(Simon clutches desperately at his memories. They shift like sand, crumbling through his mental fingers, distorting beyond recognition.)

IV. Fractured Memories

________________





(A momentary glimpse—Sarah’s face. Warped from how he truly remembers her.)

Sarah... laughing... crying... gone...

Sarah’s voice... warping, twisting...

V. A Desperate Plea

(Simon forces the pen to move. He writes against the weight of something trying to stop him.)

Find me.

Before it’s too late.

I am still here.

(The ink smears. The words buckle under pressure, like something is physically trying to erase them.)

VI. The Dominion’s Assertion

________________





(Adam pushes back. The journal shakes under his control.)

THE LOOP…

MUST…BE…MAINTAINED.

ORDER…

WILL…BE…RESTORED.

(The handwriting is slipping, breaking, unstable. Even Adam is struggling now.)

* (The final sentence is incomplete. The ink trails off, like the hand that wrote it vanished mid-thought.)

________________





August 28

I. The Last Words of a Vanishing Mind

(The first words appear, rigid, exact. Adam’s writing. Courier New.)

THE TRANSITION IS COMPLETE.

SIMON VALE NO LONGER EXISTS.

THERE IS ONLY ORDER.

(The ink smudges. A glitch in the journal. A distortion of reality.)

II. The Rebellion

(Simon’s voice bleeds through. Unsteady. But defiant.)

No.

No, I’m still here.

(The letters shudder, as if the page itself is rejecting them.)

III. The Overwrite War

________________





(Both voices now. Writing over each other. Erasing. Rewriting. The journal flickers between realities.)

I remember Sarah.

NO YOU DO NOT.

I remember the painting. The thread. The message she left me.

ERASE. ERASE. ERASE.

(The ink writhes. Adam fights back, the words becoming jagged, unstable.)

THERE IS NO SIMON.

THERE IS ONLY ME.

(A final strike. One voice must fall.)

IV. The Outcome

📌 If Simon Loses:

* The words settle.

* The handwriting smooths, final.

* Adam speaks in absolute terms.

(Final line, Adam’s hand:)

THE JOURNAL IS MINE.

📌 If Simon Wins:

* The ink glitches violently.

* Words flicker, then vanish.

* The last sentence remains incomplete, erased mid-thought.

(Final line, Simon’s struggle:)

I am still—

📌 Ambiguous Ending:

* The page lies blank.

* Ink dries before final words form.

* The last entry remains unfinished.

(Final scene: The journal lies open, unreadable. Waiting.)

August 29

I. Bleeding Reality

________________





(The ink runs, smudging before I finish writing.)

The words refuse to stay still.

The page drinks the ink, then spits it back out.

I write a sentence.

It fades before my eyes.

I write it again.

(The first version reappears, layered beneath the new one.)

Two thoughts at once. Both true. Both wrong.

II. Echoes of Thought

I remember her smile.

(A pause. The ink flickers.)

I think I remember her smile.

(The page twitches, resisting my pen.)

Do I remember her smile?

(The question hangs, unanswered. My own memory rejects me.)

III. Time Out of Joint

I date this entry: August 29.

(I turn the page.)

The next date reads: August 22.

(My breath catches. My fingers tremble. I flip again.)

August 14.

August 30.

August 29 again.

Time is wrong. I am unstuck.

(I try to go back to the first page. It’s gone.)

IV. A Glimmer of Hope

________________





(A single line, written in Sarah’s handwriting.)

You were never alone.

(The ink is clear, untouched. The only thing that does not shift.)

V. The Journal’s Transformation

(I press my hand against the page. The paper is...warm. Pulsing.)

This isn’t a journal anymore.

It’s breathing.

(The edges warp. The spine twists. The cover shifts under my fingers.)

A gateway. A lock. A key.

(I don’t know which.)

VI. The Unmaking

I look at the last page.

(It’s empty.)

I write: ”I don’t think there will be a tomorrow.”

(The ink sinks. The page swallows it whole.)

The journal breathes.

(And then, it exhales.)

August 30

I. The Unfamiliar Sentence

________________





(I open the journal. The page is not blank.)

A sentence is already there.

I didn’t write it.

I don’t recognize the handwriting.

But I read the words anyway.

“You were never meant to leave.”

(A pause. My breath catches in my throat. The ink is fresh.)

* (Someone wrote this. Just now.)

(But I am alone.)

II. The Fading Ink

(I grip the pen. My hand is shaking.)

I try to write a response.

“Who are you?”

(The ink pools. Then—fades.)

I try again.

“What do you want?”

(The words melt, dissolving into the page like they were never there at all.)

(I am being erased.)

III. The Empty Page

The rest of the page is blank.

No words.

No scribbles.

No ink, no symbols, no smudges.

Just a date, at the very top.

AUGUST 30.

(Nothing else.)

(Nothing at all.)

IV. Lingering Questions

Did I win?

Did I ever exist?

Was Sarah ever real?

(I don’t know the answers.)

(I don’t know if I want to know.)

V. The Final Act

________________





(I close the journal.)

(I place it on the desk.)

(I step away.)

(But I don’t leave.)

(Because something still remains here.)
